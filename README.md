### üìç Overview  
In the field of speech-based emotion recognition, the performance of machine learning models heavily depends on the quality and clarity of the training data. However, collecting large-scale, emotionally rich, and diverse speech datasets remains a significant challenge due to factors like human variability, limited availability of labeled data, and recording constraints. This bottleneck in data quality and volume hinders the development of robust emotion recognition systems and natural-sounding emotional speech synthesis.

Recent advancements in generative modeling‚Äîparticularly diffusion models‚Äîoffer a promising path forward. Unlike traditional generative approaches such as GANs or VAEs, which often suffer from issues like training instability or low-resolution outputs, diffusion models have shown remarkable success in generating high-fidelity samples, especially in the image domain. Applying this paradigm to the audio domain introduces new opportunities to improve emotional expression in speech data.

### ‚ùó Problem Statement  
Despite significant progress in emotion recognition and synthesis, existing emotional speech datasets often lack the expressive clarity needed for precise classification and generation tasks. Traditional augmentation and generative approaches fail to sufficiently enhance emotional salience in speech, limiting the performance of downstream tasks such as classification or expressive synthesis.

### üéØ Aim of the Study  
This project aims to explore and implement diffusion models to generate high-quality, emotionally enhanced speech data. By leveraging mel-spectrogram-based representations and incorporating emotion and utterance-style embeddings, the system synthesizes audio data that exhibits more salient and distinguishable emotional characteristics. Using benchmark datasets such as EmoDB and RAVDESS, and evaluating with ResNet-based classifiers, the goal is to demonstrate improved emotion recognition performance, thereby contributing to more accurate and expressive emotion-based AI systems.
